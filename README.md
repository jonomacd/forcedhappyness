# forcedhappyness

## To Run

Super easy

- Install go: https://golang.org/doc/install
- Install the datastore emulator: https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/tools/datastore-emulator
- Run it
```
go get github.com/jonomacd/forcedhappyness
go run main.go
open http://localhost:9091
```

No other dependancies management complications. (unless the master branch of a go dep has a breaking change. Derp.)
